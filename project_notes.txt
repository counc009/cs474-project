* After reading the documentation, I decided to write a version of a merge
  function (like is used as part of merge-sort). I noticed several other
  benchmarks that use sorted lists, but they define the sorting in relation to
  the minimum of the list, rather than just being smaller than the next value
  (where of course the tail should also be sorted).
  - In the first attempt to verify it, it identified 6 BBs:
    1. not proven ( 0.792 seconds)
      + Case of x = nil
    2. not proven ( 0.749 seconds)
      + Case of y = nil
    3. is valid   ( 0.856 seconds)
      + Case up to the recursive call when key x <= key y
    4. not proven (22.487 seconds)
      + Full case when key x <= key y
    5. is valid   ( 0.863 seconds)
      + Case up to the recursive call when key y < key x
    6. not proven ( 4.513 seconds)
      + Full case when key y < key x
